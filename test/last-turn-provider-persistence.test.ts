// Finding PM-1 — a Claude/OpenRouter session's FIRST turn recorded `null` on the
// record AND the index although the shim's log held the provider (4/4 fresh
// sessions in the post-merge smoke; turn 2 "self-corrected").
//
// 🛑 THE MECHANISM WAS NOT A RACE, AND THE EARLIER FIX (F-3) TREATED THE WRONG
// CAUSE. In the smoke the shim's line was on disk **3.1 s before** the clobbering
// write. Traced here with per-object identity on every serialize:
//
//   13:20:30.582  write  provider="Wafer"   ← on disk, correct
//   13:20:30.589  read   onDisk=null        ← THE PARSER DROPPED IT, 7 ms later
//   13:20:30.590  write  provider=null      ← and the loss is written straight back
//
// `parseSessionRecord` is an ALLOWLIST and `last_turn_provider` was not on it —
// the fourth field in this repo eaten by one (`applied_output_style`, `served`,
// `depth_projection` before it). The value was written correctly every time and
// destroyed by the next reader, which hands its parsed record back to a writer.
//
// ⚠️ WHY F-3's 3/3 WAS REAL AND STILL PROVED NOTHING: where no later writer
// happens to run, the on-disk value survives to the poll. The bug is therefore
// INVISIBLE in a rig with no late write and present in production, where the
// close path always runs. A round-trip row — this one — could not have missed it.

// SessionEventWriter's) — and because "unreachable today" is not "unreachable".
// It is tested here rather than trusted, so it cannot become untested dead code.
