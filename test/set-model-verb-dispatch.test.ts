// F-10: the CLI verb's own path did not dispatch on mechanism.
//
// ⚠️ THE ROW THAT PROVED THE DISPATCH IS GONE, AND SO IS THE DISPATCH. It needed
// a harness whose model is a config option, and none is declared any more — the
// arm was removed with the last one (brick://2b02ccd3). What survives here is the
// GUARDRAIL below: `setSessionModel` must keep emitting `session/set_model` for
// the harnesses that do use it. If a per-mechanism dispatch ever returns, it
// belongs inside `setSessionModel` — never re-inlined into the callers, which is
// the hand-maintained-list failure F-10 was.
//
// ⚠️ THE CALL IS THE DISCRIMINATOR; THE OUTCOME IS NOT. A test that only checks
// "the next turn completes" PASSES ON THE BROKEN PATH TOO, because the loud
// refusal also leaves the session healthy. So every row here asserts WHICH ACP
// METHOD went to the wire.
//
// ⚠️ THE FIX IS IN THE CLIENT, NOT THE CALLERS. Four sites reached
// `client.setSessionModel` directly (manager.ts, connected-session.ts,
// prompt-runner.ts, runtime.ts's active controller) — enumerated by SEARCH, with
// the client's own definition as the positive control. Routing them one at a time
// is the hand-maintained-list failure that produced F-9; the dispatch now lives at
// the single boundary that turns the intent into a wire call.
