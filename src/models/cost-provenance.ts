/**
 * THE STORED SHAPE OF A SESSION COST FIGURE — provenance (HOW it was derived)
 * and coverage (HOW MUCH of the session it covers), on two orthogonal axes.
 *
 * Brick 6253611b, Layer 2. **This module is INERT: it defines and derives the
 * shape, and nothing reads it yet.** Layer 3 (acpx-ui) renders it.
 *
 * ## Why two axes and not one
 *
 * Daniel's bug was a rendered quantity that did not carry the confidence of its
 * own derivation: pi reported `cost 0` for a session that really cost money, and
 * `$0` is indistinguishable from a genuinely free session. A fifth provenance
 * state would conflate *how* a number was reached with *how much* of the session
 * it accounts for, and the two fail independently.
 *
 * ## 🛑 `free` vs `unpriced` — the distinction the whole render depends on
 *
 * - **`free`** — the catalogue row EXISTS and quotes zero. A **measured** zero.
 *   `$0.00` is the correct thing to show.
 * - **`unpriced`** — **no price exists**: no catalogue row, a `variable` row, or
 *   a cold cache. **Must never render as `$0.00`.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **There IS a path where the source cannot tell them apart, and it is closed
 * here rather than left to the renderer:** when acpx's OpenRouter cache is cold,
 * every model looks price-less and would collapse into "zero". So the rule is
 * one-directional — **`free` requires a POSITIVE row quoting zero; the ABSENCE of
 * a row is always `unpriced`, never `free`.** A cold cache degrades to
 * "unknown", which is honest, instead of to "free", which is a fabricated fact.
 *
 * ## `coverage: null` means exactly ONE thing
 *
 * **"Not decomposable by construction"** — the harness handed us a single
 * cumulative total with no units to count (claude, claude-pty and opencode all
 * report `cost` and no token breakdown). **"We did not check" can never produce
 * `null`**: every derivation that has units emits counts, so a `null` from a
 * unit-bearing source would be a bug, not a state.
 *
 * ## The unit is `message`, and that is a deliberate correction
 *
 * ⚠️ **Neither `turn` nor `model` is accurate for the only harness that gives us
 * units.** pi emits one `usage_update` per assistant `message_end`, each carrying
 * a per-message delta; a turn can contain several, and a session can switch
 * models mid-flight (measured: one production session ran `kimi-k2.6` then
 * `qwen/qwen3.8-flash`), so a per-model total cannot be summed from a cumulative
 * counter without attributing one model's tokens to another. **The unit that is
 * actually summed is the usage event, i.e. the assistant message.** Naming it
 * `turn` would be a plausible label for a different quantity — exactly the
 * failure mode that produced the `modelId` composition bug.
