/**
 * PI'S OWN MODEL KNOWLEDGE — read through a SUPPORTED interface, cached under a
 * path ACPX owns.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists (brick 6253611b)
 *
 * `writePiModelsStore()` used to decide "does pi already know this slug?" by
 * looking at **the box's remote-overlay cache alone**
 * (`readBoxPiOpenRouterModels`). That asks the wrong question. pi's knowledge is
 * its **BUNDLED** catalogue PLUS that overlay, and **measured 2026-09-07: 333 of
 * the 374 models pi advertises are BUNDLED.** So the guard was unreachable for
 * 89% of the catalogue even with a populated overlay — and on a box where the
 * overlay file does not exist at all (the actual state of every dev box, because
 * acpx re-points `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` at a per-session dir it later deletes) it
 * was unreachable for **all** of it. Every session therefore fabricated an entry
 * that **replaced** pi's real one, costing the session its true price, its true
 * context window and its `thinkingLevelMap`.
 *
 * ## Why an RPC read and NOT parsing pi's bundle
 *
 * pi's catalogue is embedded in its **minified** `dist/bundle/chunks/*.js`.
 * Parsing that would couple acpx to pi's internal bundle layout, so **a pi
 * upgrade would break us SILENTLY** — landing straight back at fabrication with
 * no signal at all. `ModelRegistry` *is* a public export of pi's package entry,
 * but it is **not constructible standalone** (measured: `new ModelRegistry()`
 * succeeds, then `getAll()` throws `TypeError: Cannot read properties of
 * undefined (reading 'getModels')`), so the in-process route is closed.
 *
 * What is left is pi's own **documented RPC surface**, which is the interface
 * pi-acp itself drives: `pi --mode rpc` + `{"type":"get_available_models"}`.
 * Measured cost: **539 ms** via `spawnSync` (exit 0 — pi terminates on stdin
 * EOF), so this is affordable once and then cached.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ THIS RUNS ON THE SESSION-CREATE PATH — WHAT BOUNDS IT (brick ff298f02)
 *
 * A 539 ms synchronous spawn on every session create is a cost we do not pay for
 * a value that changes only when the pi binary does. Three bounds, in the order
 * they fire:
 *
 * 1. **A process-level memo**, so repeated creates in one acpx process do not
 *    even re-read the cache file.
 * 2. **A file cache keyed by the pi BINARY'S IDENTITY** (resolved path, mtime,
 *    size), so the spawn is paid at most once per binary per box — and, in the
 *    other direction, a pi upgrade invalidates the cache *immediately* instead of
 *    up to {@link PI_KNOWLEDGE_TTL_MS} later. Identity is strictly better than the
 *    TTL at the job the TTL was doing.
 * 3. **No pi on `PATH` ⇒ NO SPAWN AT ALL.** On every box without pi the old code
 *    paid a failed `spawnSync` per create to learn what one `stat` answers.
 *
 * And the spawn itself carries a **hard** bound: {@link PI_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS} with
 * `killSignal: "SIGKILL"`, so a wedged pi cannot hang session creation — SIGTERM
 * is catchable and a hung child is exactly the process that would catch it.
 * 15 s is affordable *because* of bounds 1–3: it is a worst case paid once per
 * binary, not per create.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ THE REFRESH RACE, MEASURED — and why this reader is a FLOOR, not a total
 *
 * pi refreshes its remote catalogue in the background at startup, so the answer
 * depends on WHEN you ask. Measured, varying only the wait:
 *
 * ```
 *   ask after    0 ms -> 333 models      ask after 1200 ms -> 374 models
 *   ask after  300 ms -> 333 models      ask after 3000 ms -> 374 models
 * ```
 *
 * A synchronous read therefore returns the **bundled floor (333)**, not the full
 * 374. **This is deliberate and it degrades in the SAFE direction:** a model in
 * the ~41 remote-only rows is classified "pi does not know it", so we write an
 * entry for it — but now with **real** rates, context window and max-tokens from
 * acpx's own catalogue, which is strictly better than the zeros this brick
 * removes. The residual (such a model still loses its `thinkingLevelMap`) is
 * filed under 6253611b rather than papered over: closing it means waiting on
 * pi's refresh, which would put >1.2 s on every session create.
 *
 * **Never widen this to "the total pi will eventually advertise" without
 * re-measuring the race — a reader that is sometimes complete is worse than one
 * that is reliably a floor, because only the second one is safe to reason about.**
